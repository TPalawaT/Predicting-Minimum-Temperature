# Predicting-Minimum-Temperature
## Overview
The python file uses time series to predict minimum temperature in Melbourne, Australia.</br>
The model uses ARIMA with (p,d,q) as (1,0,3)</br>
It has an error in prediction of 0.2Â° C.

## Code Explanation
We import several libraries namely numpy, pandas, r2_score from sklearn and ARIMA, adfuller from statsmodels.</br>
ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average and is used to train our data and predict values.</br>
It takes values p,d,q for Auto regression, Sationarity, Moving average respectively.</br>
adfuller test is Dickey Fuller test for stationarity.</br>
The code commented from line 54 to 70 is a test for AIC value for different pdq values. This also plotted various graphs. It was commented due to the interruptions graphs were causing due to repeated looping.</br>

## Further Developements
I am now trying to include not just Melbourne but any place in the world. It will not just tell the data for a day. It will predict values for the next day. Be it humidity, maximum temperature, rainfall etc. A full fledged weather predictor for tomorrow.
